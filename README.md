# CMSC-18-Project
GitHub repository for CMSC 18 Final Project

Davao City's jeepney system lacks a standardized fare calculation method, resulting in confusion and disputes among passengers and drivers. The manual calculation process is error-prone and compromises safety. This project aims to mitigate these issues by developing a C-programmed Jeepney Fare Calculator, streamlining fare computation and improving the overall commuting experience in the city.

The user will be asked different data to input that will be used by the program to calculate the total fare, namely:
- Name of the location at Point A and Point B
- Distance between Point A and Point B
- Type of Jeep (Non-Air Conditioned or Air Conditioned)
- Applicable Discount (Student, PWD, Senior Citizen, or None)
- Number of passengers
- If the user would like to calculate another fare

Based on these input data, the program will output in both the terminal and an external text file:
- The fare for each journey calculated
- Starting Point
- Ending Point
- Jeepney Type
- Applicable Discount
- Number of passengers
- Distance
- Fare Total (Base Fare, Additional Fare, Final Fare, and Total Fare (If more than one calculation))
